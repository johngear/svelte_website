# BOILERPLATE SVELTE WEBSITE

Testing Netlify deploy functionality of Svelte. This is generic code with minimal changes. Messing around with deploying Philosophy GPT via this but running into issues on the backend. 

Push to this Repo and changes to dynamic site deploys as it runs with `npm run dev -- --open` via terminal.
